### 🚗 Traffic Flow Prediction Model - Read Me 📊

This model predicts the number of vehicles 🚙 on Ngong Road based on morning traffic data from **4 AM to 10 AM**. Using **linear regression** 📈, the model establishes a relationship between time ⏰ (hours) and traffic flow (vehicles).

#### Key Components:
- **Independent Variable (x)**: Hours of the day (4 AM - 10 AM) 🕓
- **Dependent Variable (y)**: Number of vehicles observed 🚗

The regression equation:  
\( y = mx + c \), where:
- **\( m \)** = slope (rate of change in traffic 🚗 per hour)
- **\( c \)** = y-intercept (traffic flow at hour 0 🕛)

By applying this equation, the model predicts traffic flow at different times of day ⏳. For example, it can predict traffic at **12 PM**, but predictions outside the 4-10 AM range are estimates 🧐 and may vary due to changing patterns.

This model is useful for **traffic forecasting**, **urban planning**, and improving **traffic management** 🚦 based on morning rush hour trends.
